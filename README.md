A Job Portal designed to streamline job searching and recruitment. This project was built as part of my learning journey to explore the MERN stack, with an emphasis on backend development and frontend-backend integration. Here's what it offers:
✨ Key Features:
For Users: Search, filter, and apply for jobs.
For Recruiters: Create companies, post jobs, and manage applicants (accept/reject).
🛠️ Tech Stack:
reactjs | mongodb | nodejs | express | redux | react-router | cloudinary | jwt | framer motion
🔍 Room for Improvement:
Making it responsive (couldn't focus on it due to time constraints with exams approaching)
Adding light/dark modes
Updating profile picture functionality, and more
